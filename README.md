Most of us have the need to do some calculations while driving through this crazy road called life. It is known that the calculators are very helpful in such subject, but calculating is only one of this project's features. Calcio also brings joy while beign fun to use, and for the tired and lazy eyes, a color change is very possible.

<!--- comentar sobre nunca ter visto vídeos de fazer calculadora, sobre os desafios e sobre os botões que mudam de cor ---!>

Watch this gif example of Calcio doing what it does best.
